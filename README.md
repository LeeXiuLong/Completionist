<h1>Background and Overview</h1>
Wait For Sale is an application to help users find the best steam games at the best price.
The applications main statistical chart graphs games by their price as well as their overall
steam rating. This is done using a scatter plot.This helps give users a feel for whether or not
their money is being well spent. The idea was inspired by the common practice of computer 
hardware influencers giving a price/performance rating on pieces of hardware. 

There are currently no services that are offering this specific statistic. 

The application also includes other criteria to filter by such as genre of game as well as pricepoint.
A filter by individual price or overall game rating is also possible in the form of bar graphs.
